## About The Project

This project was built for a technical coding challenge. The requirements were to not use any external packages for the pagination, dataframe, and filter components. Therefore, everything in this repo is custom built. The program hits an Api, filters the data for the necessary columns, and creates the Dataframe component with the data. Additionally, there is a search bar which searches through all of the returned data, along with two filters (one for the state the restaurant is located in and the other being genre representing the type of food at the restaurant. All three of these components work together to narrow down the search for the user. Lastly, I implemented pagination where there are only 10 records per page and as you click on the page number, it adjusts the results shown.
